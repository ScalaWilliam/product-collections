Documentation has been moved to the [wiki](https://github.com/marklister/product-collections/wiki)

Product-collections is a 2D data manipulation library based on standard scala collections.  Product-collections is also a
strongly typed CSV I/O library that will read a Seq of case classes, tuples or a CollSeq for you, or serialize any of
these structures to CSV.

The data component presents a logical and consistent paradigm to replace the messy and incomplete zip3 and unzip3
scala constructs and operates with arities 1 - 22.

As of version 1.3.0 product-collections is cross-compiled for scala-js and scala-jvm.
